                            Oedipus came to a kingdom that was being haunted by a sphinx and somehow defeated this sphinx. Now, there is a great curse in the kingdom and according to a prophecy, the only way to drive away the curse is to banish or punish whomever killed the last king. Oedipus talked with another prophet, who told him that actually he was the killer...

Oedipus started looking frantically into any connections to his past that he might have, but while he calls for a servant that might have known more, a messenger appears with the message that Oedipus’ father (as far as he knows) is now dead, and not by his hand. Oedipus is relieved because now the prophecy that he will kill his father is now not true, but then the messenger

			    I’m about 2/3rds of the way through antigone, here’s a summary of what has happened up until now:
There was a big timeskip, and now all the children are grown up. The story starts right after the death of Oedipus’ sons. The translator’s notes tell us about how one son didn’t want to share the throne, so he exiled the other one, then the other one planned a coup and failed. They both put a spear through each other’s heart. After this, Creon–Oedipus’ brother in law– became king and gave the ruling that son one, the one who had ruled before him, was honorable and deserved an honorable death, and son two, the one who had been exiled, was deplorable and didn’t deserve a proper burial. After hearing of this, Antigone...

			    Dear Sophocles,
I really liked the plays you made, I especially liked how well Antigone worked as a sequel. Antigone had the same themes and tone as Oedipus Rex, and I liked how it got to continue the story and consequences of Oedipus. I loved how you handled the main theme in the story: Tragedy

			    Sophecles has not only made a great story once, but he also managed to follow it up in a cohesive way that follows the same themes, and says something new, and I think that’s amazing. Oedipus rex follows the story of the ruler–Oedipus–of a city–Thebes– in his quest...
